# OpenCV-Image-Drawing


A Python program that, using Open Computer Vision modules, takes an image, finds the edges in it, which it thickens, and blurs the image, creating the effect of a drawn image.

pip3 requirements: opencv-python, numpy, imutils,

The opencv-python install will also build dlib for your computer, so it will take a while. Use the latest version of Python 3(3.10?).

usage: python3 handDraw.py
